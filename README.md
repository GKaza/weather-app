# weather-app

The app fetches the weather data from an API for 10 big cities.
They are presented in the homepage, where they can be selected in order to see more weather details in their detail page.

App has a navbar containing navigation buttons for the 'Home', 'Categories' and 'Random' pages. The random page picks a city randomly and navigates to its detail page where there is also a button to pick a new city. There is also a footer containing a site menu.
